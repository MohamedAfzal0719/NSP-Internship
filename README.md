🌼 Iris Flower Classification – AI/ML Internship Project (Week 1)
This project was completed as part of my AI & ML Internship with NSP NEXUS. It involves building a machine learning model to classify iris flower species based on four key features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width.

🔍 One-Line Description
A machine learning model built in Python using Google Colab that predicts the species of an iris flower from its petal and sepal measurements.

📌 Project Overview
This notebook-based project uses the famous Iris dataset to demonstrate a basic classification task using supervised learning. The model classifies flowers into three species:
* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

🎯 Learning Objectives
* Understand basic classification using ML
* Load and explore datasets using pandas
* Visualize data using seaborn and matplotlib
* Train a classification model using KNeighborsClassifier
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
* Allow users to manually input their own flower measurements and predict the species

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* Google Colab (Notebook)
* Python
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

🧪 Sample User Inputs (for Testing Predictions)
Sepal Length	Sepal Width	Petal Length	Petal Width	Expected Species
5.1	3.5	1.4	0.2	Setosa 🌸
6.0	2.8	4.35	1.3	Versicolor 🌿
6.5	3.0	5.5	2.0	Virginica 🌺
✅ Features Implemented
* Load and display Iris dataset
* Data exploration using visualizations (pair plots, count plots)
* Data preprocessing and train/test split
* K-Nearest Neighbors model training
* Evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix
* Custom user input support to predict flower species dynamically

📎 How to Use This Notebook
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run each cell step by step
3. In the “User Input Section”, provide:
    * Sepal Length (e.g., 5.1)
    * Sepal Width (e.g., 3.5)
    * Petal Length (e.g., 1.4)
    * Petal Width (e.g., 0.2)
4. View the predicted species for the given inputs
