🎓 Student Performance Prediction – AI/ML Internship Project (Week 2)

This project was completed as part of my AI & ML Internship with NSP NEXUS.

It involves building a logistic regression model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on two key features:
📚 Hours Studied and 🏫 Attendance Percentage.

🔍 One-Line Description
A machine learning model built in Python using Google Colab that predicts a student’s pass/fail outcome from their study hours and attendance.

📌 Project Overview
This notebook-based project demonstrates a binary classification task using logistic regression.
The model uses a simple, small dataset with the following columns:
	•	Hours_Studied
	•	Attendance (%)
	•	Pass/Fail (1 = Pass, 0 = Fail)
The model is trained to classify whether a student will pass or fail based on their study habits and attendance.

🎯 Learning Objectives
	•	Understand binary classification using Logistic Regression
	•	Create and explore a dataset using pandas
	•	Visualize the data using matplotlib
	•	Train and test a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
	•	Evaluate model performance using accuracy score
	•	Predict pass/fail for custom input values

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
	•	Google Colab (Notebook)
	•	Python
	•	Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn
 
 🧪 Sample Dataset
 Hours_Studied
Attendance (%)
Pass/Fail
5 85 1
2 60 0
4 75 1
1 50 0
✅ Features Implemented
	•	Manual dataset creation and loading
	•	Data exploration using simple visualizations
	•	Data preprocessing and train-test split
	•	Logistic Regression model training
	•	Accuracy evaluation
	•	Custom user input support for prediction

📎 How to Use This Notebook
	1.	Open the notebook in Google Colab
	2.	Run each cell in order
	3.	In the “User Input Section”, provide:
	•	Hours Studied (e.g., 4.5)
	•	Attendance Percentage (e.g., 80)
	4.	View the predicted result: Pass (1) or Fail (0)
